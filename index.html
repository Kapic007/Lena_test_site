            Hello! I am glad to welcome you to my website! A little about myself
            and creativity. I am Ukrainian. For a long time I painted pictures
            using ink, pencil, watercolor, oil paints. During my studies at the
            university, I completely switched to computer graphics. I prefer to
            work as an illustrator. I especially like to draw people. I am
            experimenting with directions of graphics, so my drawings are very
            diverse. I have experience in typography, so I am familiar with the
            production processes, and many of my works have been brought to
            life.
